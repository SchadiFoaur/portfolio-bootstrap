        Blog page designing - Forth Entry

      <p>
        Although it took around 3 days. I am now officially done with the
        homepage. I made some minor adjustments, color corrections, and some
        simple css animations. After i was finished with the home page i moved
        to the blog page. Since i had already been familiar with everything, it
        didn't take much time to redesign the entire page. I made it pretty
        close in concept to the homepage theme. I also added an icons near the
        titles and linked one of them to the very first entry i wrote. <br />
        Then i decided to make an image carousal and thought it would be better
        to show before/after images. I tried about 6 times, but was
        unsuccessful. My guess is that whatever i am doing wrong is messing with
        bootstrap's javaScript and ruining the entire website. <br />
        After i gave up i added the footer to all my previous entries and
        naturally a new problem came up. The footer was not sticking to the
        bottom of the page but to the last line of the content. For example if
        all the content took only 50% of the page then the footer would be
        sticking directly under the content and not the bottom of the entire
        page. I did all i could, but was again unsuccessful, so i just decided
        to add more content to the page. that way it would be forced to be at
        the very bottom.

        Here is an image of the how the new blog page looks.
